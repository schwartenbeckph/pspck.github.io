<div>
  <p>I have a background in academic research and AI engineering and aim to translate cutting-edge AI research into useful applications.</p>
  
  <p>In my academic research, I worked at the intersection of AI and biological science, mostly in London and Oxford (UK), but also in Germany. I investigated the nature of flexible, generalisable, and compositional intelligence in algorithms and biological data, focusing on reinforcement learning, Bayesian Inference and pattern analysis methods.</p>
  
  <p>As an AI Engineer, I worked as a project lead and developer building Gen AI solutions in production. I also presented this work frequently in talks or blogs with a focus on Agentic AI (e.g. graph-based reasoning in agentic AI or Agentic Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)) and reinforcement learning.</p>
